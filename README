Designed for Gentoo Linux

This script generates an initramfs image with all the included files and
dependencies needed to mount your filesystem.

Please have the following installed:

- Linux Kernel
  ZLIB_INFLATE/ZLIB_DEFLATE can be compiled as a module but must be declared
  in the 'mods' variable in pkg/hooks/addon.py (Used for ZFS)
  * If you don't compile these modules (or load them), you will get an
    "unknown symbol" error when zfs is attempted to be used at boot.

  General setup --->
  > [*] Initial RAM filesystem and RAM disk (initramfs/initrd) support
    () Initramfs source file(s)

  Device Drivers --->
  > Generic Driver Options --->
    [*] Maintain a devtmpfs filesystem to mount at /dev
    [*] Automount devtmpfs at /dev, after the kernel mounted the rootfs
  > [*] Multiple devices driver support (RAID and LVM) --->
    <*> Device mapper support
    <*> Crypt target support

  Cryptographic API --->
  * Any ciphers you need in order to unlock your encrypted drive should be
    enabled as either a module or built into the kernel.

  * All other drivers required to see your PATA/SATA drives (or USB devices)
    need to be compiled in or you can compile them as a module and declare
    them in the 'mods' variable in pkg/hooks/addon.py.
